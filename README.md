## 🏁 Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>

The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Rocket Lab is a small satellite provider. Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. SpaceX’s accomplishments include: Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station. Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access. Sending manned missions to Space. One reason SpaceX can do this is the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

In this capstone, I take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I have to do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
